# LinAlgAngularSpringNodes

This project includes a Spring MVC backend and an Angular frontend. 

Documentation is available for the angular component in /angular/documentation.

In theory, running mvnw spring-boot:run should download and build all components (maven uses the gulp plugin to build and install angular components), frontend and backend.

If on Fedora, make sure to dnf install jblas.

This is a work in progress.
